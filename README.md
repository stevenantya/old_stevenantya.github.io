## Welcome to Steven's Page

Hello there fellow technology enthusiasts! My name is Steven Antya Orvala Waskito, a highschooler from Indonesia. I've been digging the computer science realm since 2017. The latest project I have been working on is about data science analysis. Please, take a look!

# Latest Project ( ANALYSIS OF NBA PLAYER'S TWITTER FAME )

In this project, I used jupyter notebook, matplotlib and pandas library as my tools!

I used a scatter plot comparing the salary, number of wins and compare them to the twitter famousness factor such as retweets and number of followers. The X-axis is either the salary or number of wins, while the Y-axis is the twitter famousness factors, so as you go up the Y-axis, you're more famous than ever!

However, from my analysis of the 2016-2017 NBA season players, I am confident to say that
Neither the salary or the number of wins significantly increases NBA player's twitter fame.

I will be posting my other projects here, so stay tune for more!
